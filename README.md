# jStockWatcher

...Another unfinished project in Java. 
Was supposed to be a program that actively got stock data from the internet via web scraping OR via some sort of API and then you could manipulate said that as you pleased. Program wasn't meant to have a realworld use and it was just something I started to start programming again.
